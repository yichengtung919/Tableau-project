## Project/Goals
The goal of the project is to explore the given data sources and use tableau as the primary tool to draw insights from the them and visualize the outcomes. By answering the questions, relationships between different tables are built through it. 

## Process
### Explore different tables from the data sources provided and have a basic understanding of what the data source is about.
### Build connection between different tables through common elements.(Date in this case)
### Visualize data in response to the questions provide and draw insights
### Identify problems and analyze if the visualization is helpful to answer the questions
### Create a dashboard to summarize 

## Results
Option 1 was chosen for this project. 

All the tables are connected through date data except for the json file for weekly earnings since we were given a meta data which is unclear what each data point means and there are no date data or any common data to be found to connect to other tables. Since one of the data sources can not be used for further analysis, two of the given questions were not able to be answered. 

A common observation for the tables on property price index is that it is increasing consistantly throughout the years. Even during economic crisis the index did not seem to be affected by the events significantly. Both the house and office prices stayed around the same level during economic crisis. The sector that is mostly affected by the economic crisis is the house construction, which reduced a lot during the economic crisis years.

The heatmap question was only able to be answered by using the data in office real estate index table, because the other datasets were not divided into regions as require in the question. Therefore it won't be the best representation of what the total housing price in these regions.

The regression model for housing price and consumer index returned a positive relationship with an R squared of 0.699 and p value less than 0.0001 which means that the regression line can explain close to 70% of the data points and it is statistically significant.

## Challenges 
The first challenge is to understand the datasets and have an idea of what elements are included in the datasets. 
The second challenge is to fit what the best visualization is for each question. 


## Future Goals
I would format the visualization so it looks more aesthetically pleasing. Exploration on improving the regression model could also be performed.
